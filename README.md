# data-engineering-concepts
This repository contains my 'DATA ENGINEERING CONCEPTS' outline modeled after (but not strictly aligned with) the flow of the Dataquest Data Engineer course. The Jupyter Notebook file ('technique_demo.ipynb') is a "practice space" with code representing many but not all of the various techniques that make up the outline.
